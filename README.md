# XellSB_17489
### About
A rough test app designed to shadowboot a running Xbox 360 Devkit (17489 Kernel) into Xell (Can be adapted to support other types of shadowboot).
Uses the latest version of Xell bundled with the JRunner app.

### Notes
- App is a standalone and does not require any shadowboot roms to be placed beside it.
- Must be running Developer kernel version 17489 (21256.18). Does not support Testkits.
- Currently requires KdNet to be enabled to prevent an unknown hang/crash (Checks are in place).
- JTAG/RGH consoles must be running a Developer kernel with SB booloader signature patches.
